Aquatic Aspirations is a mod project by me, that aims to add a method of resource generation to minecraft using custom fish and fishtanks.

----------------------------------------------

In its base state, it includes:

-A fish for most vanilla resources, along with deafult methods to obtain them.

-Substrate blocks to utilize in resource production (or build with, if you really wanted.

-A Fishtank Block entity that facilitates resource production.

-Fishtank Accessories that alter Fishtank fucntionality.

-A Fishbowl, which is a Fishtank with a fancier texture, but no functionality aside from displaying the stored fish. Use it to decorate your home!

---------------------------------------------------------

This is my first modding endeavour, and more than that, my first real coding project at all. The 'Aspirations' part is mine. I dreamt of a mod idea and wanted to bring it into reality.

Given that this is my only real experience coding, the source code will be messy, and most likely not the way you would write it. That's okay! And I'm open to suggestions. The best part of modded minecraft is the dedicated community, after all.

---------------------------------------------------------

Planned features include:

-Living fish mob entities for each fish

-Fishtank Multiblock capabilities

-An Aquarium mechanic allowing players to turn a body of water into a functioning fish tank.

(If you think you would be able to help with these plans, and would like to, please reach out. I'm friendly, I promise.)

-If you would like to contribute to Aquatic Aspirations, please feel free to reach out. You will certainly be more experienced than I am.

-If you would like to create your own fork, please feel free. I just ask two things: Credit me for the ideas, and please implement the Diamond Fish texture in some capacity. It's important to me.

-Addons are welcome! Want to add some custom content to Aquatic Aspirations with your own mod? I have no idea how to do that, but it would be very cool!

-No permission is needed to add this mod to a modpack. Keep in mind that it will *always* be WIP, and bugs aren't unlikely. Please let me know if you run into issues.

Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy my mod <3
